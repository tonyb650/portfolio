A key function is that Wedding Wordsmith helps wedding participants write their vows and speeches with an LLM-powered interview process. The application handles a multitude of user roles: owner, wedding planner, bride, officiant, and speaker. This entails significant complexity as a single user may be in multiple weddings and have different roles in each.\n\nThe project is written in Typescript with a React front end and a Node / ExpressJS back end.

This is a reminder that 3-5 minutes away from a task is often crucial to recharge and regain perspective. And 4) Allow the flexibility for pausing, continuing, and completing tasks early. This is crucial as the flow of a day is never predictable.\n\nThis is a MERN project written in Javascript.",

Using TensorFlow and Python, we defined, compiled, fit, and finally saved this purpose-built model. We then converted the model for TFJS and utilized it within our front end application to make predictions. The predictions are meant to decide the best way to schedule time-flexible activities on the user's calendar.\n\nA secondary emphasis in this project was to implement robust, production-ready authentication and authorization including **email verification, 2-factor authentication**, and **password reset** functionality.\n\nThe web application was built with NextJS, NextAuth, Prisma, Resend and MySQL and is live at **https://calendify.dev**",
